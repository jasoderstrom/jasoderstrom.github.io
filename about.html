                I'm Justin Soderstrom, a Software Engineer currently living in Pierre, South Dakota. I got started into software development when I was 15, making small programs for fun. However, I didn't really get serious about development until I started college at <a href="http://dsu.edu/">Dakota State University</a>, where I graduated this past May with a 4.0 in Computer Science.   
            </p>
            <p>
                I use this website to not only document what I learn on my technical adventures, but to also share what I learn. My goal is to write short, clear, and easy-to-follow guides for beginner/intermediate software engineers that make no assumptions about skill level.
            </p>
            <p>
                I strongly believe in the value of education and the free sharing of information, which is why you will never see any ads, popups, or sponsorships on my site.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also use this site to occassionally jot down my thoughts, so you will also find some non-technical/non-tutorial articles on here.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of the technical realm, I love to play video games, hike, and occassionally travel.
