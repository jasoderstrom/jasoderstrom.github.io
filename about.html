                I'm Justin Soderstrom, a Software Engineer currently living in Pierre, South Dakota. I got started into software development when I was 15, making small programs for fun. However, I didn't really get serious about development until I started college at Daktoa State University, where I graduated with a 4.0 in Computer Science.

            <p>
                I use this website to not only document what I learn on my technical escapades, but to share it. My goal is to write short, clear, and easy-to-follow guides for beginner/intermediate software engineers that make no assumptions about skill level.
            </p>
            <p>
                I strongly believe in the value of education and the free sharing of information, which is why you will never see ads, popups, or sponsorships on my site.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of the technical realm, I love to play video games, hike, and occassionally travel.
