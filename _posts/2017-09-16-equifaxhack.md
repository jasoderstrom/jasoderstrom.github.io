# What is the Equifax Hack?

Unless you've been living under a rock, then you've likely heard about the recent Equifax hack. If you haven't, then check out [this](http://time.com/money/4933204/equifax-hack-credit-report-identity-theft/) article. In a nutshell, the major credit bureau Equifax was hit with a massive cybersecurity attack in which social security numbers, birth dates, addresses, and other personal information was leaked to hackers. In all, over 143 million U.S customers were affected by the hack. That's almost half the country!

# How does this affect me?

If you're an American citizen, there is around a 50% chance that you've been affected by this hack. Meaning, there is a 50% chance that your personnel information is in the hands of criminals. With your information, these criminals can commit identity theft and open fradulent credit cards, bank accounts, or file tax returns in **your name.** Recovering from identity theft is a long and painful process to go through should you be a victim.

If you want to know for sure if you've been affected by the hack, Equifax has setup a [website](https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com/) where you can find out if you've been affected. However, recent reports have come out stating that the site is giving different results for the same information. Since Equifax's site is horribly broken, it is safer to just assume that you **have** been affected.

# What should I do?

First, relax. You're not alone in this. There are a lot of great resources that are popping up all over the internet that go into detail on what to do. Just do a basic [Google search](https://goo.gl/7SdEkC). Due to the wide-spread availbility of information on the subject, I'll only give an overview on what most of them say to do.

In general you should: 

1. Freeze your credit files at the 4 major credit bureaus ([Equifax](https://help.equifax.com/s/article/ka137000000DSDyAAO/What-are-the-security-freeze-fees-in-my-state), [Experian](https://www.experian.com/freeze/center.html), [Innovis](https://www.innovis.com/personal/securityFreeze), and [Trans Union](https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze/place-credit-freeze)). 

2. Put an alert on your file with [ChexSystems](https://www.chexsystems.com/) (or freeze it).

3. Opt out of pre-approved credit cards [here](https://www.optoutprescreen.com/)

4. Get a free copy of your free credit report quarterly [here](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action)

An article written by cyber security reporter Brian Krebs goes into more detail on each of these steps [here](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/the-equifax-breach-what-you-should-know/). The article takes a Q/A style to explaining everything, making it an easy read.

# Conclusion

The Equifax hack is one of the worst cyber security breaches in recent history and should not be taken lightly by any American citizen. Get yourself educated on the hack and what options are available to protect yourself. Please take action **soon** or risk being a victim of identity theft later.
